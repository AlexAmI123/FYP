// OVERVIEW:
// guessedGameState == STATE_NOT_GUESSED is used to mean that there is no active guess
//
// We use the whistle to guess at transitions from SET to PLAYING (at kickoff,
// for a set play penalty kick, or for a penalty shootout penalty kick) and from
// PLAYING to READY (after a goal has been scored except in a penalty shootout)
//
// We check for a bad guess at the SET to PLAYING transition by checking if
// any of our team is penalised for illegal motion in set.
// We check for a bad guess at the PLAYING to READY transition by checking if
// the READY state was not signalled by the game controller after the expected
// 15 sec delay plus additional operator delay

// we'll process the whistle in all states because it might be used for custom
// features in behaviour
