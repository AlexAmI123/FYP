# RoboEireann revised code base (derived from 2021 B-Human Code Release)

Please note that **before** you clone this repository on Windows, execute the following commands:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.eol lf
```

This code base is a fork of the 2021 B-Human Code Release 
with RoboEireann specific modules and features added.

For all RoboEireann documentation, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/roboeireann/rematch/wiki) for more information.


Documentation for the official official 2021 B-Human code release 
can be found in their [public wiki](https://wiki.b-human.de/coderelease2021/).

Note that RoboEireann does not explicitly support some B-Human features such as 
use on Windows/Mac so if you are trying to do that and something does not 
work out, you will need to sort it yourself.
