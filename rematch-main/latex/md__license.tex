Preamble\+: B-\/\+Human releases most of the software it uses at Robo\+Cup competitions to allow teams participating in the Standard Platform League that do not have the resources to develop a complete robot soccer system on their own, but still have important contributions to make to the goals of Robo\+Cup. We intend to enable such teams to benchmark their own scientific approaches in Robo\+Cup competitions. We also hope that the scientific community will benefit from their work through the publication of their findings. A second reason for B-\/\+Human releasing its code is that source code is the most solid documentation of how problems were actually solved.

Parts of this distribution were not developed by B-\/\+Human. This license doesn\textquotesingle{}t apply to these parts, the rights of the copyright owners remain.

The announcement shall name which parts of this code are used. It shall also contain a description of the own contribution that addresses the criteria set by section A.\+1 of the SPL rule book.
