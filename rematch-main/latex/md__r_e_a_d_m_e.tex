This code base is a fork of the 2021 B-\/\+Human Code Release with Robo\+Eireann specific modules and features added.

For all Robo\+Eireann documentation, head over to the \href{https://github.com/roboeireann/rematch/wiki}{\texttt{ wiki}} for more information.

Documentation for the official official 2021 B-\/\+Human code release can be found in their \href{https://wiki.b-human.de/coderelease2021/}{\texttt{ public wiki}}.

Note that Robo\+Eireann does not explicitly support some B-\/\+Human features such as use on Windows/\+Mac so if you are trying to do that and something does not work out, you will need to sort it yourself.
